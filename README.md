# Data-structures-and-algorithms.
In this project, I created an advising assistance program to efficiently store, organize, and retrieve course data. The program reads data from a file, organizes courses in alphanumeric order, and enables the user to search for particular courses and their prerequisites. The way I achieved this was by comparing the pros and cons of each data structure, such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees (BSTs), thus allowing me to determine the most appropriate data structure for the type of data the program handles, while having in mind performance and memory consumption. I faced difficulties in parsing CSV files and executing data structure algorithms, but I overcame these by dividing the problem into smaller tasks and leveraging class resources, online tutorials, and W3Schools. This project enhanced my software design skills by learning to design solutions using pseudocode and focusing on optimization prior to programming. This project also assisted me in coding more maintainable, readable, and flexible programs by utilizing proper structure, descriptive variable names, and well-organized logic, which will be beneficial in future projects.
